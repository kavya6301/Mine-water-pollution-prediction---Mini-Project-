This study will investigate the use of artiﬁcialneural networks(ANNs) for mine water quality prediction by implementing an AI-based model. The coal mining in Meghalaya causes large-scale destructionand degradation of the environment. The main problems in Meghalaya are the production of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) in nearby areas by continuous leachingof acidic waste from the coal mining sectors. So we’ll try to develop the prediction system by usingparameters such as mine water (it’s pH, sulphate, or heavy metals like arsenic)concentration, Rainfall, air temperature, depth to the groundwater table, and also if possiblethe groundwater geological aquifer parameters(like what type of rock is in between themine surface and groundwater) will be used as inputs parameter whereas sulfate concentrationas output. A graphical user interface (GUI) will be developedby combining long short-term memory nets (LSTM) for each of the four input parametersand an ANN combining the LSTM outputs to predict future sulfate values
